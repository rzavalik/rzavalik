<h3 align="left">üë©‚Äçüíª  About Me</h3>

###

<p align="left">
I am a technology and innovation enthusiast with a relentless commitment to continuous learning and excellence. As the winner of the 2nd PUCRS Entrepreneurial Tournament, I laid the groundwork for my innovative approach in the technology field early in my career.
</p>
<p align="left">
My academic background includes a degree in Business Administration with an emphasis on IT Management, complemented by a technical diploma in Business Management from QI. This robust theoretical and practical foundation enables me to tackle complex challenges effectively. Currently, I am further expanding my knowledge with an MBA in Cloud Computing at FIAP, positioning myself at the forefront of cloud technologies and digital transformation trends.
</p>
<p align="left">
My professional journey is diverse and rich in experience. Over more than a decade, I have led projects ranging from re-hosting to re-architecture for various companies. This has allowed me to gain deep expertise in technologies such as AWS, GCP, and Azure, and to develop solutions using .NET Core, C#, SQL Server, IIS, as well as modern architectures like Microservices, ServiceBus, and Service Broker.
</p>
<p align="left">
Throughout my career, I have taken on key roles including .NET Developer, .NET Software Architect, Development Manager, and Entrepreneur. Each of these roles has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of business needs and the software lifecycle, enabling me to lead effectively and drive innovation.
</p>
<p align="left">
At AUTOMATE, where I have led products and projects, I have the privilege of working on mission-critical initiatives that involve complex migrations and sophisticated integrations. Our product, AUTOMATE, has become an essential pillar for service providers, data centers, and large corporations across LATAM.
</p>
<p align="left">
In addition to my practical achievements, I hold Microsoft certifications in C# .NET and am in the process of obtaining certifications in Azure and Office 365, further strengthening my expertise in Microsoft cloud technologies.
</p>

Lately I work as a full stack developer allocated to Canon EMEA via BairesDev.
