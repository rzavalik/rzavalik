## 👩‍💻  About Me
<br/>

I am a technology and innovation enthusiast with a relentless commitment to continuous learning and excellence. As the winner of the 2nd PUCRS Entrepreneurial Tournament, I laid the groundwork for my innovative approach in the technology field early in my career.
My academic background includes a degree in Business Administration with an emphasis on IT Management, complemented by a technical diploma in Business Management from QI. This robust theoretical and practical foundation enables me to tackle complex challenges effectively. Currently, I am further expanding my knowledge with an MBA in Cloud Computing at FIAP, positioning myself at the forefront of cloud technologies and digital transformation trends.

My professional journey is diverse and rich in experience. Over more than a decade, I have led projects ranging from re-hosting to re-architecture for various companies. This has allowed me to gain deep expertise in technologies such as AWS, GCP, and Azure, and to develop solutions using .NET Core, C#, SQL Server, IIS, as well as modern architectures like Microservices, ServiceBus, and Service Broker.
Throughout my career, I have taken on key roles including .NET Developer, .NET Software Architect, Development Manager, and Entrepreneur. Each of these roles has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of business needs and the software lifecycle, enabling me to lead effectively and drive innovation.

At AUTOMATE, where I have led products and projects, I have the privilege of working on mission-critical initiatives that involve complex migrations and sophisticated integrations. Our product, AUTOMATE, has become an essential pillar for service providers, data centers, and large corporations across LATAM.
In addition to my practical achievements, I hold Microsoft certifications in C# .NET and am in the process of obtaining certifications in Azure and Office 365, further strengthening my expertise in Microsoft cloud technologies.
Lately I work as a full stack developer allocated to Canon EMEA via BairesDev.
